# FoosballSensor_IndProject23

Welcome to my Foosball table project! The goal of this project is to have an automatic counter for each team in foosball. This is to prevent aguing between players on what is the offical score since players tend to forget to update their score mannually. For more information and details on the code and project itself, please refer to the wiki page on github. 

There are two codes shared on this page, titled RedTeam and BlueTeam. Each are for the teams titled and should be uploaded to the their respected Arduinos. Please visit the "Writing Code for Teams" wiki page for details on these codes.
