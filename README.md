# FoosballSensor_IndProject23
Written Proposal:

For my Individual Project, I would like to modify a foosball table. My plan is to purchase a pre-built foosball table that I can make embedded system additions on.


When players forget to tally their own score, it can cause issues when playing the game along with arguments between competitors. Instead of having players keep track of their own score, I would like to add an automatic scorekeeper in each player’s goal. I am planning to achieve this idea by adding touch sensors that the foosball ball can land on when dropped into the goal. Once the ball hits the sensor, I want to build a code that counts the detected motion as a goal. From there, it would add a tally to the player’s score along with some form of success audio (adding audio such as “SCORE!” with background music). So players know what their score is, I am planning on adding a LCD to each side of the foosball table, with each displaying the score that the player has earned so far. 

Here is a drawn out version of my ideal placement of the modifications:

An additional idea that I came up with if I have extra time is adding an LED strip to the table. My goal would be to line the LED strip along the perimeter and have it go off when a goal is detected. Depending on which player scores, the LED will light up to whichever color the player's foosball team is. For example, if the person using the red players scores, I would have the LED light up with the color red.
